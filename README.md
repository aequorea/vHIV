# vHIV
An HIV vaccine (preliminary). -- This version shows more clearly the symmetry between creating a glycosylated HIV neutralizing molecule (see aequorea/zHIV) and using designed-in glycans to create an epitope focused vaccine.

When I had the glycodesign software pick glycosylation sites on the N6 fragment, I did it with the fragment bound to gp120 to avoid glycosylating the binding pocket. Maybe a good way to make a vaccine would be to design glycans into gp120 instead. It's a method of "epitope focusing."

There is probably more to making a vaccine that would encourage antibodies that bind CD4 than just making vaccine molecules, injecting them, and then getting nice antibodies from a single vaccination. Broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting the CD4 binding site take a while to develop. There is significant "affinity maturation" of the antibody binding site going on and this can take time. In an HIV patient it can take years for broadly neutralizing antibodies to form. The question is, can we speed up this process?

HIV may already be telling us something about how to encourage the evolution of broadly neutralizing antibodies. The HIV early entrants, or "pioneers," have statistically fewer N-linked glycosylation sites and may have fewer glycans than HIV viruses that have been part of an infection for a while. Maybe this is part of the co-evolution of HIV with the antibodies that has been seen in cases where broadly neutralizing antibodies have arisen in the course of an HIV infection. In the vaccine's sequence of molecules, start with fewer glycans and a more accessible CD4 binding site and progress to more glycans and a less accessible CD4 binding site.
