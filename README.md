# vHIV
An HIV vaccine (preliminary). -- This version shows more clearly the symmetry between creating a glycosylated HIV neutralizing molecule (see aequorea/zHIV) and using designed-in glycans to create an epitope focused vaccine.

I wondered if it was possible to get the immune system to make more antibodies like N6 by making a vaccine. When I had the glycodesign software pick glycosylation sites on the N6 fragment, I did it with the fragment bound to gp120 to avoid glycosylating the binding pocket. Maybe a good way to make a vaccine would be to design glycans into gp120 instead. It's a different method of "epitope focusing." Maybe this is something we should be looking into, not just for HIV, but for other things as well. Find the conserved region on a virus, and use glycodesign to focus on it.

I call this design "preliminary" because there are many different HIV isolates and I don't know which version of gp120 would work the best. I don't know how different the CD4 binding sites in different isolates really are. I don't know how the immediate surroundings of the CD4 binding site varies between the different isolates. It might be nice to know something about the structures of the isolates that N6 doesn't work on. This might tell us something about how to improve the antibody and maybe how to produce a better vaccine.
